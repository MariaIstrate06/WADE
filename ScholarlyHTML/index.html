      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        TRASD is a (micro-)service based Web System able to detect road/traffic signs marking a highly 
        frequented route (by vehicles or pedestrians) given by the user in the form of a video or a picture. 
        For each recognized road sign, information regarding regulatory aspects, type, meaning and relationships
        to other signs is provided by the system, adding suggestions regarding user behaviour.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        There are many applications out there that might offer information regarding road sign positioning
        by accessing map application APIs, yet what TRASD brings to the table is a micro-service based system
        that collects every sign and gives explanations and other regulatory information to the user.

      </p>

        Since the modern ages, GPS systems have proven their necessity and people have become more and more dependent on them
        as they can manage to ease the trouble of travelling. Besides that, out-of-the-country travelling without 
        having to ask for direction is now easier than ever. But wouldn't it be easier if the signs shown on the maps
        also had explanations, taking into consideration that their looks may differ from country to country.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Goals:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create and develop a useful micro-service based web system.</li>
        <li>Be fully funcitioning on modern Web browsers</li>
        <li>
          Be customizable for inclusion in arbitrary Web sites, while remaining easy to process
          and interoperable.
        </li>
        <li>Build on top of open, royalty-free standards.</li>
        <li>Long-term viability as a data format.</li>
        <li>Proper use of ontologies.</li>
        <li>Present everything in a easy-to-read and embed format.</li>

      </ul>
